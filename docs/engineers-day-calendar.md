An opinion of 22/Feb/2026 from a $$ AI Chatbot when given

;

PROMPT 1

Fetch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_Day

Greatly compress it

Give me a list of dates starting with today 22/Feb/2026 and ending with 21/Feb/2027

For each day, list the country codes celebrating that day for engineers. Like at 22/Feb through 28/Feb show US as celebrating

Can do?

Show me your finished work?

Never show me two blank days in a row. Just delete all the blank days

PROMPT 2

Ok this is a great start, and points to you for declaring your big bug = Variable dates (Malaysia, Egypt, Nepal, etc.) not included due to movable scheduling

You know which of these days are in 2026 or 2027

Fix your bug
