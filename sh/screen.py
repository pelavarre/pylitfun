usage: screen.py [-rr] [-ls] [HINT]

reconnect with one Screen Session

options:
  -rr     reconnect with one Screen Session
  -ls     list the Screen Sessions from most to least recently created (except unreliable at Linux?)

quirks:
  steals ⌃A away, burying the work of ⌃A at ⌃A A
  appends more lines into the "logfile $T.screen", doesn't start over
  flushes often only when told "logfile flush 0"

quirks better than classic:
  starts by showing the disconnected & connected Screen Sessions
  doesn't forward trailing Blank Lines from its call of 'screen -ls', when no Sessions found
  does exit zero when one or more Disconnected Screen Sessions found
  does exit nonzero when no Screen Sessions found, or no Disconnected Screen Sessions found
  doesn't explain that macOS '-ls' always exits 1 vs Linux exits 1 when no Disconnected Sessions

easter eggs, same as classic:
  echo $STY  # to say you're inside a Screen Session or not
  ⌃A D  # to disconnect
  ⌃A ⎋  # to enter 'Copy Mode' else say 'Must be on a window layer'
  ⌃A ⎋ ⎋  # to exit 'Copy Mode' and say 'Copy mode aborted'

more easter eggs, same as classic:
  ⌃A ⇧| to Add Pane > Insert Right
  ⌃A Tab to move Cursor between Panes
  ⌃A C to launch a Shell in a new Pane
  ⌃A ⇧X to Close Pane

examples:

  screen.py --  # for to call 'screen -r' for you on one Screen Session
  screen -ls |sort -n  # sort by Process Id, thus often by Date Added
  screen -X hardcopy -h ~/s1.screenlog  # post-mortem call for a Screen Session Log

  HEAD_PID=$(screen -ls |awk -F'\t' '(NF > 1){print $2}' |cut -d. -f1 |head -1)
  MAX_PID=$(screen -ls |awk -F'\t' '(NF > 1){print $2}' |cut -d. -f1 |sort -n |tail -1)
  screen -r $MAX_PID

  T=$(echo alfa) \
    && echo "logfile $T.screen" >$T.cfg \
    && echo "logfile flush 0" >>$T.cfg \
    && T=$T screen -S $T -L -c $T.cfg  # for to make a real-time $T.screen log file
